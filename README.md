      <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> I had never been responsible for investing cleint accounts into their desired portfolios so I had to reach out and ask for help from co-workers in order to complete the task. I also had to learn to navigate the fotware the firm used to execute these trades in a span on one work day as this was an extremely time sensitive task.</p>
